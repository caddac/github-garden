# Project: Interactive Garden Timeline Visualization

## Overview
Create a GitHub Pages-hosted website that displays an interactive garden visualization with time-based plant data. The site should allow users to view the garden's state at any point in time, showing what plants were present and their status.

## Core Features

### 1. Garden Visualization
- Top-down 2D view of the garden layout
- Static representation of garden structure (boxes, planters, paths)
- Plants displayed in their physical locations
- Clean, modern interface following Google Material Design principles

### 2. Plant Data Management
- Simple, human-editable data format (e.g., YAML or JSON)
- Time-based data structure to track plant presence and status
- Initial data fields:
  - Common name
  - Planting date
  - Harvest date
- Data structure should be extensible for future attributes

### 3. Time Navigation
- Interactive timeline control
- Ability to view garden state at any specific date
- Smooth transitions between time periods
- Clear indication of current date being viewed

### 4. Technical Requirements
- Hosted on GitHub Pages
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Fast loading and smooth performance
- Clean, maintainable code structure
- Easy to update plant data without technical knowledge

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
```yaml
plants:
  - name: "Tomato"
    location: "Planter A"
    planting_date: "2024-03-15"
    harvest_date: "2024-07-15"
    # Additional fields can be added later
```

### Technical Stack
- Frontend: React or Vue.js for interactive components
- Styling: Material Design components
- Data: YAML/JSON files stored in the repository
- Build: Static site generator (e.g., Next.js, Gatsby)

### User Experience
- Intuitive timeline navigation
- Clear visual distinction between different plant states
- Easy-to-read plant labels and information
- Smooth animations for time transitions
- Mobile-friendly interface

## Future Considerations
- Add more plant attributes (growth stage, care instructions, etc.)
- Implement search/filter functionality
- Add photo gallery for plants
- Include seasonal planning features
- Add plant care reminders

## Success Criteria
1. Garden layout is clearly visible and understandable
2. Users can easily navigate through time
3. Plant data is simple to update and maintain
4. Site performs well on all devices
5. Code is well-documented and maintainable
6. Design follows Material Design principles
